# Chapter 2: Using Information Technology for Competitive Advantage

* The customer-focused business lies in the ability of the firm to keep customers loyal, anticipate their future needs, respond to customer concerns, and provide top-quality customer service
* This strategy depends on customer values to recognize quality rather than prices
* Customers see businesses that offer the best value to be the ones that are able to;
  * keep up with individual preferences
  * Keep up with market trends
  * Supply products, services and information anytime, anywhere
* CRM(Customer Relation Management) systems and Internet, intranet, and extra-net websites create new channels for interactive communications within a company, with customers, and with the suppliers, business partners, and others in the external environment.
  * This enables continual interaction with customers by most business functions and encourages cross-functional collaboration with customers in product development, marketing, delivery, service, and technical support
* Customers use the Internet to ask questions, send complaints, evaluate products, request support, and make and report their purchases.
* Using the Internet and corporate intranets, specialists in business functions throughout the enterprise can contribute to an effective response.
  * This encourages the creation of cross functional discussion groups and problem-solving teams dedicated to customer involvement, service, and support.

### Re-engineering Business Processes(BPR)

* Re-engineering is a fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in cost, quality, speed, and service.
* This combines a strategy of promoting business innovation with a strategy of making major improvements to business processes so that a company can become a much stronger and more successful competitor in the marketplace.
* The potential risk and payback of re-engineering is high since making risk changes to business processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness is not an easy task
* Many companies have found that re-engineering can best be achieved when the whole organization is redesigned while leveraging the power of IT.
* For example, one common approach is the use of self-directed cross-functional or multidisciplinary process teams. Employees from several departments or specialities including engineering, marketing, customer service, and manufacturing may work as a team on the product development process. Another example is the use of case managers, who handle almost all tasks in a business process, instead of splitting tasks among many different specialists

### The Role of IT in BPR

* Computer and Internet Technologies can improve efficiency of processes as well as collaboration between the people responsible for their operation and management

### Becoming an Agile Company

* Agility, in business performance, is the ability of a company to prosper in rapidly changing, continually fragmenting global markets for high-quality, high-performance, customer-configured products and services.
* Companies applying this tactic make profit in markets with broad product ranges and shorter timelines and produce orders individually and in set sizes
* It supports mass customization by offering individualized products while maintaining high volumes of production. Agile companies depend heavily on Internet technologies to integrate and manage business processes, while providing the information processing power to treat masses of customers as individuals.
* Strategies to archive agile production include.
  * Customers are to view products and services as solutions to their products
  * The company must cooperate with customers, suppliers and other companies not excluding competitors to bring products to the market rapidly with the least cost
  * The company must be able to thrive regardless on change and uncertainty using flexible structures tied to the requirement of different customers
  * The company must be able to balance between the impact of its people and the knowledge they have

### Virtual Companies

* A virtual company (also called a virtual corporation or virtual organization) is an organization that uses information technology to link people, organizations, assets, and ideas.

#### Virtual Company Strategies

* Share infrastructure and risk with alliance partners.
* Link complementary core competencies.
* Reduce concept-to-cash time through sharing.
* Increase facilities and market coverage.
* Gain access to new markets and share market or customer loyalty.
* Migrate from selling products to selling solutions.

### Building a Knowledge-Creating Company

* Successful companies are those that are able to thrive on creating new knowledge , disseminate it widely throughout the organization, and quickly embody it in new technologies and products
* These companies exploit two kinds of knowledge
  * Explicit Knowledge Data
  * Tact Knowledge

#### Knowledge Management Systems

* Many companies build knowledge management systems (KMS) to manage organizational learning and business know-how with the goal of helping knowledge workers create, organize and make available important knowledge
  * This includes processes, procedures, patents, reference works, formulas, "best practices," forecasts, and fixes.
* Knowledge management systems facilitate organizational learning and knowledge creation.
  * They are designed to provide rapid feedback to knowledge workers, encourage behaviour changes by employees, and significantly improve business performance.
  * As the organizational learning process continues and its knowledge base expands, the knowledge-creating company works to integrate its knowledge into its business processes, products, and services.
  * This helps the company become a more innovative and agile provider of high-quality products and customer services, and a formidable competitor in the marketplace. Now let's close this chapter with an example of knowledge management strategies from the real world.
