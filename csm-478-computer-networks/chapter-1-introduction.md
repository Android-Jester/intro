# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Networks

* A system of computers and other devices as nodes linked by a communication media for the purpose of sharing information, resources or both

### Data Communication

* This is the exchange of data between two devices through a transmission medium
  * There are five components
    * Protocol
    * Sender
    * Receiver
    * Message
    * Medium
  * The effectiveness of data communication systems depends on
    * Delivery
    * Accuracy
    * Timelines
    * Jitter or error
  * Types of data flow include
    * Simplex
      * One directional
    * Half duplex
      * Bi directional but one communication at a time to avoid collision
    * Duplex
      * Bidirectional at the same time

### Distributed Processing

* This is the process at which tasks are divided amongst multiple computers
* This involves each computer in a network handling subset of processes

#### Advantages include

* Security
* Distributed Databases
* Faster problem solving
* Security through redundancy
* Collaborative processing

### Benefits of a network

* _Information Sharing_
  * Authorized users can use other computers on the network to access and share information and data
* _Hardware Sharing_
  * One device can be used by many users
* _Software Sharing_
  * A software on a server can be used by many people on the same license instead of purchasing and installing multiple licenses for the same software to be installed on multiple machines
* _Collaborative Environment_
  * Users can work together on group projects by combining the power and capabilities of diverse equipment

#### Risks of networks

* Security challenges
  * Virus attacks
  * Hackers
  * System Failure
  * Equipment Failure

### Criteria for assessing network effectiveness and efficiency

* Performance (measured using Transit Time, Response Time). Depends on Number of users, Type of transmission medium, Hardware, Software
* Reliability (measured by accuracy of delivery, network reliability, frequency of failure, recovery time of network after failure, network readiness in event of catastrophe.
* Security (i.e. Protecting data from unauthorised access and viruses

### Communication Media

* A Communication Channel is the link between two computers by which data flows
* The medium is a physical object or wireless medium which creates the channel

#### Physical Medium

* **Twisted-pair cable** – consists of two independently insulated wires twisted around each other
* **Coaxial cable** – consists of an insulated center wire grounded by a shield of braided wire
* **Fiber-optic cable** – contains hundreds of clear fiberglass or plastic fibers/threads (made from thin, flexible glass tubing; bandwidth is greater, so it can carry more data; it is lighter than metal wires and is less susceptible to interference)
* **ISDN line** – a special digital telephone line that transmits and receives information at very high speeds

#### Wireless Medium

* Microwave system – transmits data via high-frequency radio signals through the atmosphere
* Satellite system – receive transmitted signals, amplify them, and then transmit the signals to the appropriate locations
* Cellular technology – uses antennae resembling telephone towers to pick up radio signals within a specific area (cell)
* Infrared technology – transmits data as infrared light waves from one device to another, providing wireless links between PCs and peripherals

### Types of Networks

* **LAN(Local Area Networks)**
  * a network that spans a small area such as a building or an office.
* **WAN(Wide Area Networks)**
  * a network that spans a wide geographical area; there are several types of WANS
    * Metropolitan area network(MAN)
    * Public access network(PAN)
    * Value added network(VAN)
    * Virtual private network(VPN)
* **Intranet**
  * A private LAN designed for use by everyone within an organization.
  * An intranet might consist of an internal e-mail system, a message board and one or more Web site portals that contain company news, forms, and personnel information.
  * Access to an intranet’s web site is restricted by a firewall.
* **Extranet**
  * A network that connects people within your company with people who are outside your company all within a secure, password-protected network that can be accessed from anywhere.

### Network Categorization

#### Protocol

* An agreed-on set of rules and procedures for transmitting data between two or more devices

**Features determined by protocol**

* Successful sending of message
* Successful receiving of message
* Error Checking

**Protocols used**

**Network Protocols**

* Ethernet LANs
  * Ethernet LANs use a bus topology.
  * All stations are connected to a single long cable.&#x20;
  * Any station can send a signal along the cable, which all other stations will receive.
  * Unlike ring topologies, the cable doesn't close a loop.
* IBM's token Ring Protocol
  * A token passing ring LAN is a group of computers connected in a loop.&#x20;
  * The group uses a token passing access mechanism.&#x20;
  * A computer trying to send data should first receive permission.&#x20;
  * When it gets control of the network it may transmit a frame.&#x20;
  * Each frame transmitted on the ring is transmitted from one computer to the next, until it ultimately returns to the initiator of the transmission.

**Communication Protocols**

* TCP/IP&#x20;

### Architecture

* **Network architecture**
  * refers to the way a network is designed and built.
  * The two major types are:
  * **Peer-to-peer architecture**
    * Computers connect with each other in a workgroup to share files, printers, and Internet access.
  * **Client/server architecture**
    * sends information from a client computer to a server, which then relays the information back to the client computer, or to other computers on the network

### Topology

* **Network Topology/Layout**
  * refers to the arrangement of nodes in a network
* Types include
  * **Bus topology**
    * all computers are linked by a single lione of cable
    *

  * **Star topology**
    * multiple computers and peripheral devices are linked to a central computer, called a host
    *

  * **Ring topology**
    * each computer or workstation is connected to two other computers, with the entire network forming a circle
    *

  * **Hybrid topology**
    * combine network layout types to meet their needs
